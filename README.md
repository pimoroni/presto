## Get Pimoroni Presto

* [Pimoroni Presto](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/presto)

## Download Firmware

You can find the latest firmware releases at [https://github.com/pimoroni/presto/releases/latest](https://github.com/pimoroni/presto/releases/latest).

There are two choices, a regular build that just updates the MicroPython firmware and a "-with-examples" build which includes everything in [examples](examples).

:warning: If you've changed any of the code on your board then back up before flashing "-with-examples" - *your files will be erased!*

## Installation

1. Connect Presto to your computer with a USB-C cable.
2. Put your device into bootloader mode by holding down the BOOT button whilst tapping RESET.
3. Drag and drop the downloaded .uf2 file to the "RP2350" drive that appears.
4. Your device should reset, and you should then be able to connect to it using [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).
